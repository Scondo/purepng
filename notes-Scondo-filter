bytearray causes an 8% penalty (in 8-bit images) due to
reallocating each row. It is considered harmful.

Cython instructions are unclear (and I don't care much).

convert_la_to_rgba seems very slow; ditto convert_l_to_rgba; and
convert_rgb_to_rgba.

iBaseFilter isn't necessary. Or is it? It's used later for
16-bit images.

Need documentation for filter_type in class Writer.

byteextend now applies filters. Rename appropriately.

The "Apply a scanline filter" comment seems to have gone.
replace it.

adapt_methods etc is badly commented.

adapt_sum and adapt_entropy inconsistent style. Also, can we
use min() with a key= argument (probably not in Python 2.2)

"return array('B', raw)" should be bytearray? (actually no)

Why have iteridat() and iterdecomp been renamed?
